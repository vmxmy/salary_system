# 2.1 Frontend Current Development Plan (v2)

This document outlines the implementation plan and phases for the v2 Frontend, based directly on `docs/v2/V2实施计划.md`.

## 1. Project Goal & Migration Strategy

*   **Goal:** Build the v2 frontend (`frontend/v2/`) using Vite + React + TypeScript + Ant Design, interfacing with v2 backend APIs.
*   **Strategy:** Migrate and refactor functionalities from the existing `salary-viewer` (React) project, adapting them to the new v2 architecture. This is preferred over a rewrite from scratch or modifying the older Vue project.

## 2. Implementation Phases (from `docs/v2/V2实施计划.md`)

### Phase 1: Preparation & Base Infrastructure Setup
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Verify development environment and dependencies (`frontend/v2/package.json`).
    *   Confirm v2 project structure in `frontend/v2/`.
    *   Set up base routing (`frontend/v2/src/router/routes.tsx`) and main layout components.
    *   Integrate state management (e.g., Redux Toolkit store and basic slices like auth).
    *   Build base API service layer (`frontend/v2/src/api/api.ts`) with Axios instance and interceptors.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 1-2 Weeks

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Migration & Refactoring
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Migrate authentication modules (Login, Register, User Profile pages and logic from `salary-viewer/src/pages/`).
    *   Migrate `SalaryDataViewer` component and related sub-components (tables, filters) and logic from `salary-viewer/src/components/SalaryDataViewer/`.
    *   Connect migrated components to v2 backend APIs (e.g., `webapp/v2/routers/payroll.py`).
    *   Migrate basic data management pages (Employees, Departments if in `salary-viewer` scope, e.g., `salary-viewer/src/components/EmployeeManager.tsx`).
*   **Estimated Duration:** 4-6 Weeks

### Phase 3: Extended Functionality Migration & Optimization
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Migrate email services (config, payslip sending from `salary-viewer/src/components/EmailConfigManager.tsx`, `PayslipSender.tsx`).
    *   Migrate reporting features (viewer, manager from `salary-viewer/src/components/ReportViewer.tsx`).
    *   Optimize advanced table features (column settings, filtering, export).
    *   Integrate Dify chatbot.
    *   Complete internationalization (i18n) support.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 3-4 Weeks

### Phase 4: Testing, Optimization & Deployment
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests for key components and functions.
    *   Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing.
    *   Perform performance analysis and optimization.
    *   Conduct security checks.
    *   Configure production build and deployment processes for the v2 frontend.
*   **Estimated Duration:** 2-3 Weeks

## 3. Overall Estimated Timeline
*   **Total:** 10-15 Weeks (subject to change based on actual progress and complexities).

## 4. Key Technical Details & Standards (from `docs/v2/V2实施计划.md`)

*   **Tech Stack:** Vite, React, TypeScript, Ant Design, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Axios, @ant-design/charts, @dnd-kit, xlsx.
*   **Code Standards:** Follow React/TypeScript best practices, use ESLint and Prettier.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit slices and `createAsyncThunk` for global state and async ops.
*   **API Integration:** Encapsulated Axios, unified request/response handling, auth, error handling.
*   **Component Design:** Differentiate common, layout, and business components.
*   **Permission Control:** Role-based route guards and UI element visibility.

## 5. Risks and Mitigation Strategies (from `docs/v2/V2实施计划.md`)

*   **Learning Curve:** Provide training/resources for the tech stack.
*   **Migration Difficulty:** Assess old code complexity and plan migration carefully.
*   **API Changes:** Maintain close communication with the backend team.
*   **Performance Issues:** Continuously monitor and optimize performance.

## 6. Quality Assurance (from `docs/v2/V2实施计划.md`)

*   Code reviews for all changes.
*   Unit tests for core logic/components.
*   Integration tests for module interactions.
*   End-to-end tests simulating user behavior.
*   Manual functional and UX testing.

*This plan is a direct reflection of `docs/v2/V2实施计划.md` and should be the guiding document for frontend v2 development. Progress against these phases should be tracked regularly.*
