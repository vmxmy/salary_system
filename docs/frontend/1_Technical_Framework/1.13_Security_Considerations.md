# 1.13 Security Considerations (Frontend v2)

This document outlines key security considerations for the v2 frontend, based on Chapter 16 ("安全性考虑") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Strong Authentication:** Implement robust login mechanisms. User credentials should always be transmitted over HTTPS.
*   **Token-Based Authentication (JWT):**
    *   Store JWTs securely. `localStorage` is common but susceptible to XSS. `HttpOnly` cookies (set by the backend) are generally more secure against XSS but have CSRF considerations if not properly handled.
    *   If using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for tokens, be extra vigilant about XSS prevention.
    *   Tokens should have a reasonable expiration time.
    *   Implement refresh token mechanisms if long-lived sessions are required.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforce authorization based on user roles and permissions as detailed in `1.6_Routing_and_Authorization.md`. Frontend checks are for UX; the backend must always enforce definitive authorization.
*   **Secure Logout:** Ensure logout properly invalidates the session/token on both client and server-side (if applicable) and clears any sensitive user data from the client state.

## 2. Input Validation

*   **Client-Side Validation:** Validate all user inputs on the client-side before submitting to the backend. This improves UX by providing immediate feedback but is not a substitute for server-side validation.
    *   Use libraries like `Yup` or Zod, or Ant Design's built-in form validation.
    *   Validate for type, format, length, required fields, etc.
*   **Server-Side Validation:** The backend MUST always re-validate all inputs. Never trust client-side validation alone.

## 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

*   **React's Built-in Protection:** React automatically escapes content rendered within JSX, which helps prevent XSS when displaying data.
*   **Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** Use this prop with extreme caution and only with sanitized HTML. Never use it with user-supplied content that hasn't been rigorously sanitized by a trusted library.
*   **Sanitize User Inputs:** When displaying user-generated content that is not rendered through React's JSX (e.g., if injecting HTML into a non-React part of the page or from an external source), use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header via server configuration to restrict the sources from which content (scripts, styles, images) can be loaded, further mitigating XSS risks.

## 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention

*   If using cookie-based authentication, implement CSRF protection mechanisms:
    *   **SameSite Cookies:** Use `SameSite=Lax` or `SameSite=Strict` attributes for session cookies.
    *   **Anti-CSRF Tokens:** The backend should generate and validate anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
*   For token-based authentication (like JWTs in headers), CSRF is generally less of a concern for API requests, provided the token is not automatically sent by the browser (i.e., not in cookies without `SameSite` attributes).

## 5. API Security

*   **HTTPS:** All API communication must be over HTTPS.
*   **Rate Limiting:** The backend should implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   **Input Sanitization (Backend):** The backend should sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, NoSQLi, etc.).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Backend):** API endpoints should only expose data and operations necessary for the user's role.

## 6. Dependency Management

*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep project dependencies (npm packages) up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Audit Dependencies:** Use tools like `npm audit` or Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Use Trusted Sources:** Only use packages from reputable sources.

## 7. Secure Headers

Configure the web server to send security-related HTTP headers:

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** As mentioned above.
*   **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Enforces HTTPS.
*   **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff:** Prevents MIME-sniffing.
*   **X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN:** Protects against clickjacking.
*   **Referrer-Policy:** Controls how much referrer information is sent.

## 8. Data Handling

*   **Minimize Sensitive Data on Client:** Avoid storing unnecessary sensitive data on the client-side or in client-side state (Redux store). If sensitive data must be temporarily held, clear it as soon as it's no longer needed.
*   **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** Handle PII with care, ensuring compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## 9. Error Handling and Logging

*   **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Information in Errors:** Ensure that error messages displayed to users or logged do not inadvertently reveal sensitive system details or user data.
*   Secure logging practices (see `1.12_Error_Handling_and_Logging.md`).

## 10. Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing

*   Consider periodic security code reviews and, for critical applications, professional penetration testing.

Security is an ongoing process, and these considerations should be revisited throughout the development lifecycle.
