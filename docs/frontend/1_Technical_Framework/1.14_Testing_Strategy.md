# 1.14 Testing Strategy (Frontend v2)

This document outlines the testing strategy for the v2 frontend, based on Chapter 17 ("测试策略") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Goals of Testing

*   **Ensure Correctness:** Verify that the application functions as expected and meets requirements.
*   **Prevent Regressions:** Catch bugs introduced by new code or modifications to existing code.
*   **Improve Code Quality:** Writing testable code often leads to better-designed, more modular code.
*   **Increase Confidence:** Provide confidence in deployments and refactoring efforts.
*   **Documentation:** Tests can serve as a form of living documentation for how components and functions are intended to be used.

## 2. Testing Levels

A multi-layered testing approach will be adopted:

*   **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual units of code in isolation (e.g., React components, utility functions, Redux reducers/selectors, custom hooks).
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between multiple units (e.g., a page component with its child components and API service calls, or Redux actions with reducers and selectors).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Test complete user flows through the application, simulating real user scenarios in a browser-like environment.
*   **Manual/Exploratory Testing:** Human-driven testing to explore the application, find usability issues, and test edge cases not easily covered by automated tests.

## 3. Tools and Frameworks

*   **Test Runner & Assertion Library:** **Jest** is the recommended test runner. It includes a built-in assertion library and mocking capabilities.
*   **React Component Testing:** **React Testing Library (`@testing-library/react`)** is preferred for testing React components. It encourages testing components in a way that resembles how users interact with them, focusing on behavior rather than implementation details.
*   **E2E Testing (Consideration):**
    *   **Playwright** or **Cypress** are strong candidates if dedicated E2E testing is implemented. The choice depends on team preference and specific project needs (e.g., cross-browser testing capabilities of Playwright vs. developer experience of Cypress).
*   **Code Coverage:** Jest provides built-in code coverage reporting. Aim for meaningful coverage rather than just high percentages.

## 4. Unit Testing Strategy

*   **What to test:**
    *   **React Components:** Test component rendering based on different props and state, user interactions (clicks, input changes), and conditional logic.
    *   **Utility Functions:** Test pure functions with various inputs and expected outputs.
    *   **Custom Hooks:** Test the logic within custom hooks, mocking any external dependencies.
    *   **Redux Store (if applicable):**
        *   Test reducers to ensure they update state correctly based on actions.
        *   Test action creators (especially async thunks, mocking API calls).
        *   Test selectors to ensure they derive the correct data from the state.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Write tests that are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
    *   Focus on testing the public API/behavior of a unit, not its internal implementation.
    *   Use descriptive test names (`it('should render correctly when data is provided')`).
    *   Mock dependencies (e.g., API calls, other modules) to isolate the unit under test.

## 5. Integration Testing Strategy

*   **What to test:**
    *   Interaction between a parent component and its children.
    *   Components interacting with the Redux store (dispatching actions, selecting state).
    *   Components making API calls (mocking the API response) and updating based on the result.
    *   Page-level components rendering correctly with their constituent sub-components.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Define clear integration boundaries.
    *   Mock external services (like APIs) at the boundary.
    *   Focus on the flow of data and events between integrated parts.

## 6. End-to-End (E2E) Testing Strategy

*   **What to test:** Critical user flows and core functionalities of the application from the user's perspective.
    *   Login/Logout flows.
    *   Core CRUD operations (e.g., creating an employee, submitting a payroll run).
    *   Key navigation paths.
    *   Forms submission and validation.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Write E2E tests for stable features.
    *   Keep E2E tests focused on high-level flows; avoid testing minute details better suited for unit/integration tests.
    *   Use clear and resilient selectors (e.g., `data-testid` attributes) to interact with DOM elements, making tests less brittle to UI changes.
    *   Manage test data carefully.
    *   E2E tests can be slower and more resource-intensive, so prioritize critical paths.

## 7. Test Execution and CI/CD

*   **Local Execution:** Developers should run tests locally before pushing code.
*   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Consider using tools like Husky and lint-staged to run linters and relevant tests (e.g., staged file tests) automatically before commits.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate test execution (unit, integration, and potentially E2E) into the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins). Builds should fail if tests do not pass.
*   **Reporting:** Configure CI to report test results and code coverage.

## 8. Manual Testing

*   **Exploratory Testing:** Testers (or developers) should manually explore the application to find bugs or usability issues that automated tests might miss.
*   **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Manually test on different browsers and devices, especially for UI-heavy features, to ensure consistency.
*   **Usability Testing:** Gather feedback from actual users or stakeholders on the application's ease of use.

A comprehensive testing strategy combining these different levels will be crucial for delivering a high-quality and reliable frontend application.
