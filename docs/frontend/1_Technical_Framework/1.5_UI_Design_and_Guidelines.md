# 1.5 UI Design and Guidelines (Frontend v2)

This document outlines UI design principles, component strategies, styling guidelines, and specific UI features for the v2 frontend, drawing heavily from `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. General UI/UX Principles

*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look and feel across the application, leveraging Ant Design's comprehensive design language.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure UI elements, labels, and messages are clear and unambiguous.
*   **Efficiency:** Design workflows that allow users to complete tasks with minimal effort.
*   **Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, success/error messages).
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Strive for WCAG AA compliance where possible. Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes as needed. Ant Design components are generally accessible but ensure proper usage (e.g., `alt` text, `aria-label`).

## 2. Component Structure and Strategy

(Refer to `1.1_Frontend_Architecture.md` for the base project structure for components)

The application employs a modular component structure:

*   **通用基础组件 (`components/common/`):**
    *   Pure UI components with no business logic.
    *   Examples: Custom buttons, icons (if not covered by Ant Design), loading spinners, error message displays.
    *   Primarily leverage Ant Design components directly.
*   **布局组件 (`components/layout/`):**
    *   Responsible for the overall page structure.
    *   Examples: `Header`, `Footer`, `Sidebar`, `PageContentWrapper`.
*   **业务通用组件 (`components/business/`):**
    *   Contain specific business logic and are reusable across multiple pages or features.
    *   Examples: `EmployeeSelector` (fetching and displaying a list of employees for selection), `DepartmentTree`, `RoleSelector`.
*   **图表组件 (`components/charts/`):**
    *   Specialized components for data visualization.
    *   Examples: `SalaryBarChart`, `PayrollDistributionPieChart`. (See also `1.10_Data_Visualization.md`)
*   **页面组件 (`pages/`):**
    *   Combine common, layout, and business components to form complete page views.
    *   Each page corresponds to a specific route and feature of the application.

**Ant Design Usage:**
*   Ant Design is the primary UI library. Utilize its components extensively.
*   Customize components via their props.
*   For global theme changes or significant style overrides, refer to the Styling section.

## 3. Styling and Theming

(Refer to `1.9_Styling_and_Theming.md` for detailed theming instructions)

*   **Primary Reliance on Ant Design:** Most styling should come directly from Ant Design components and their default styles.
*   **Theme Customization (`styles/theme.less`):**
    *   Modify Ant Design's Less variables to customize the global theme (e.g., primary color, border radius, font family).
    *   This is the preferred way to achieve a consistent brand look and feel.
*   **Component-Specific Styles:**
    *   Use CSS Modules (e.g., `MyComponent.module.less`) for styles that are tightly coupled with a specific component and need to be scoped to avoid conflicts.
    *   Styled-components or other CSS-in-JS solutions can be considered if the team prefers, but CSS Modules with Less is a good default.
*   **Global Styles (`styles/index.less`):**
    *   Keep global style overrides to a minimum.
    *   Use for very generic styles or utility classes that are broadly applicable and not component-specific.
    *   Avoid overriding Ant Design's core component styles globally unless absolutely necessary and well-documented.

## 4. Advanced Table Component Features

Leverage Ant Design Table's capabilities and consider custom enhancements for a rich user experience:

*   **Column Customization:**
    *   Allow users to show/hide columns.
    *   Allow users to reorder columns (e.g., using `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable` integrated with the table).
*   **Advanced Filtering:**
    *   Provide per-column filtering options (text, number range, date range, select).
    *   Implement global table search.
*   **Data Export:**
    *   Functionality to export table data to CSV or Excel (e.g., using the `xlsx` library).
    *   Allow export of current view or all data (considering pagination).
*   **Row Selection:** For batch operations.
*   **Expandable Rows:** To show more details for a specific row.
*   **Fixed Columns:** For tables with many columns, keep key identifier columns fixed while scrolling horizontally.
*   **Custom Cell Rendering:** Use custom render functions for complex data display or actions within cells.

## 5. Guided Tour and Feature Discovery

*   **Ant Design Tour Component (`<Tour />`):**
    *   Utilize the `Tour` component to guide new users through key features or to introduce new functionalities after an update.
    *   Plan tour steps carefully to be concise and helpful.
    *   Trigger tours contextually (e.g., first login, visiting a complex page for the first time).
*   **Contextual Help/Tooltips:**
    *   Use Ant Design `Tooltip` or `Popover` components to provide hints or explanations for complex UI elements or input fields.

## 6. Sidebar Interaction and Optimization

*   **Collapsible Sidebar:** Allow users to collapse and expand the main navigation sidebar to maximize content viewing area. State should be persisted (e.g., in `localStorage` or global state).
*   **Responsive Behavior:**
    *   On smaller screens (tablets), the sidebar might auto-collapse or switch to a drawer-style navigation.
    *   Ensure menu items remain accessible and usable.
*   **Active Item Indication:** Clearly indicate the currently active menu item.
*   **Scrollable Menu:** If the number of menu items exceeds the available height, the menu should be scrollable.
*   **Dynamic Menu Generation:** The sidebar menu items should be dynamically generated based on the user's role and permissions (see `1.6_Routing_and_Authorization.md`).

## 7. Overall Page Layout and Structure

(Refer to `1.1_Frontend_Architecture.md` for layout component structure)

*   **Consistent Header:** Contains application logo/name, user profile information/actions (e.g., logout), and potentially global notifications.
*   **Main Content Area:**
    *   Use breadcrumbs for easy navigation and context.
    *   Employ clear page titles.
    *   Structure content logically using cards, sections, and appropriate spacing from Ant Design's grid and layout components.
*   **Footer (Optional):** May contain copyright information or useful links.

These guidelines aim to create a user-friendly, consistent, and efficient interface for the Salary Information Management System.
