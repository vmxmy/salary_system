# 1.15 Deployment and Build Process (Frontend v2)

This document outlines the build and deployment process for the v2 frontend, drawing from Chapter 9 ("Vite 构建流程") and Chapter 18 ("部署与构建流程") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Build Tool: Vite

*   **Vite** is used as the build tool for the frontend application.
*   **Development Server:**
    *   Command: `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`), which typically executes `vite`.
    *   Features: Fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), efficient development experience.
*   **Production Build:**
    *   Command: `npm run build` (or `yarn build`), which executes `vite build`.
    *   Output: Generates optimized static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in the `dist/` directory (or as configured in `vite.config.ts`).
    *   Optimizations: Minification, tree-shaking, code splitting, asset hashing are handled by Vite automatically for production builds.
*   **Configuration (`vite.config.ts`):**
    *   This file in the project root is used to configure Vite's behavior, including:
        *   Base public path.
        *   Server options (port, proxy for API requests in development).
        *   Build options (output directory, sourcemaps).
        *   Plugins (e.g., for framework support, image optimization, bundle analysis like `rollup-plugin-visualizer`).
        *   Path aliases (`resolve.alias`).

## 2. Environment Configuration for Builds

*   Vite uses `.env` files to manage environment-specific configurations (see `1.4_Development_Environment_Setup.md` for details).
*   **Build Modes:** Vite supports different modes (e.g., `development`, `production`, custom modes).
    *   `vite build` defaults to `production` mode.
    *   `vite build --mode staging` can be used to build for a staging environment, loading variables from `.env.staging`.
*   Environment variables (prefixed with `VITE_`) are embedded into the client bundle at build time.

## 3. Deployment Strategy (General Steps)

The specific deployment steps will depend on the chosen hosting environment (e.g., Nginx, Docker, Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3/CloudFront).

1.  **Code Checkout:** Obtain the latest stable version of the code from the main/production branch of the Git repository.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all project dependencies are installed using the correct package manager and lock file (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
3.  **Environment Setup:** Ensure the correct `.env` file for the target environment (e.g., `.env.production`, `.env.staging`) is present or that build-time environment variables are correctly injected by the CI/CD system.
4.  **Run Production Build:** Execute `npm run build` (or `yarn build`) to generate the optimized static assets in the `dist/` directory.
5.  **Deploy Static Assets:**
    *   **Static Hosting (e.g., Nginx, Apache, S3, Netlify, Vercel):** Copy the contents of the `dist/` directory to the web server's document root or the static hosting service.
    *   **Containerization (Docker):**
        *   A `Dockerfile` should be created to build a production image.
        *   This typically involves a multi-stage build:
            1.  A build stage to install Node.js, copy source code, install dependencies, and run `npm run build`.
            2.  A production stage (e.g., based on `nginx:alpine`) to copy the `dist/` folder from the build stage and configure Nginx to serve the static files.
        *   The Docker image is then pushed to a container registry and deployed.
6.  **Web Server Configuration (if applicable, e.g., Nginx/Apache):**
    *   Configure the web server to serve the `index.html` file from the `dist/` directory for all client-side routes (SPA fallback configuration). This ensures that refreshing a page on a client-side route still loads the application correctly.
    *   Example Nginx configuration for SPA fallback:
        ```nginx
        location / {
          try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }
        ```
    *   Set appropriate caching headers for static assets (CSS, JS, images) to improve performance for returning visitors.
    *   Configure HTTPS.

## 4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

*   **Automation:** Automate the build and deployment process using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines).
*   **Pipeline Steps (Typical):**
    1.  Trigger on push/merge to main/production branch.
    2.  Checkout code.
    3.  Set up Node.js environment.
    4.  Install dependencies.
    5.  Run linters and tests (fail build if they don't pass).
    6.  Perform production build (`npm run build`) with target environment configuration.
    7.  Deploy to the target environment (e.g., push to S3, build and push Docker image, deploy to PaaS).
    8.  Optionally, run health checks or E2E smoke tests post-deployment.
    9.  Send notifications on success/failure.

## 5. Rollback Strategy

*   Have a plan for rolling back to a previous stable version in case a deployment introduces critical issues.
*   This might involve redeploying a previous Docker image tag, reverting a commit and re-triggering CI/CD, or using features of the hosting platform.

## 6. Monitoring Post-Deployment

*   Monitor application logs and error tracking services (e.g., Sentry) for any new issues after deployment.
*   Track key performance metrics.

This process ensures that deployments are consistent, reliable, and automated, minimizing manual errors.
