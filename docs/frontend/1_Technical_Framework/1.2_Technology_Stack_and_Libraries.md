# 1.2 Technology Stack and Libraries (Frontend v2)

This document lists the core technologies, frameworks, and libraries for the v2 frontend development of the Salary Information Management System. Information is sourced from `docs/v2/项目开发核心信息.md`, `docs/v2/前端 2.0 设计框架.md`, and `docs/v2/V2实施计划.md`.

## 1. Core Framework & Language

*   **UI Framework/Library:** React (Version 18, as per `项目开发核心信息.md`)
*   **Programming Language:** TypeScript (~5.7.2, as per `项目开发核心信息.md`)

## 2. Build Tool & Development Environment

*   **Build Tool:** Vite (^6.3.1, as per `项目开发核心信息.md` and `V2实施计划.md`)
    *   Provides fast development server and optimized production builds.

## 3. UI & Styling

*   **UI Component Library:** Ant Design (Version TBD - mentioned in `前端 2.0 设计框架.md` and `V2实施计划.md`)
    *   Provides a comprehensive set of enterprise-grade React UI components.
*   **Styling:** 
    *   Less (for Ant Design theme customization via `styles/theme.less`)
    *   CSS Modules (for component-levelscoped styles, if needed)
    *   Global CSS/Less (`styles/index.less`)

## 4. State Management

*   **Primary Option:** Zustand (Mentioned in `前端 2.0 设计框架.md` as a good starting point)
*   **Alternative/For Complex Scenarios:** Redux Toolkit (Mentioned in `前端 2.0 设计框架.md` and `V2实施计划.md`)
    *   Includes Immer, RTK Query.
    *   *Decision on primary state management should be finalized and documented if not already.*

## 5. Routing

*   **Client-Side Routing:** React Router (Version TBD - standard choice for React, implied by usage of `ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

## 6. API Communication

*   **HTTP Client:** Axios (^1.8.4, as per `项目开发核心信息.md` and `V2实施计划.md`)
    *   Used for all communication with the backend v2 API.

## 7. Utility Libraries (mentioned in `V2实施计划.md`)

*   **Charting:** @ant-design/charts (For data visualization)
*   **Drag and Drop:** @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable (For implementing drag-and-drop functionalities)
*   **Excel File Handling:** xlsx (For parsing or generating Excel files, e.g., for import/export)

## 8. Code Quality & Formatting

*   **Linter:** ESLint (Implied standard for React/TypeScript projects, mentioned for frontend in `API 架构2.0md` which might be an error and meant for frontend context)
*   **Formatter:** Prettier (Implied standard, see above)
*   *Specific configurations for these tools should be defined in the project (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc.js`)*

## 9. Other Dependencies (from `docs/v2/项目开发核心信息.md`)

*   `vue-tsc`: Mentioned in `项目开发核心信息.md`. **Its relevance to a React/Vite project needs to be confirmed and likely removed if not applicable to `frontend/v2/`.**

## 10. Versioning & Dependency Management

*   **Package Manager:** npm or Yarn (Project should standardize on one).
*   **Dependency File:** `package.json` (lists all frontend dependencies and their versions).
*   **Lock File:** `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (Yarn) to ensure reproducible installs.
*   It is crucial to keep dependencies updated and manage versions carefully.

*This list should be kept in sync with the project's `frontend/v2/package.json` file.*
