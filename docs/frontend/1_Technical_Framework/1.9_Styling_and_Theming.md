# 1.9 Styling and Theming (Frontend v2)

This document covers the styling strategy and how Ant Design theming is handled in the v2 frontend, based on Chapter 8 ("样式管理") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Primary Styling Library: Ant Design

The project primarily relies on Ant Design for UI components and their inherent styling. This ensures a consistent, professional look and feel with a wide range of ready-to-use components.

## 2. Theme Customization (`src/styles/theme.less`)

Ant Design allows for extensive theme customization by overriding its underlying Less variables.

*   **Method:** Create a `theme.less` (or similar, e.g., `antd-customizations.less`) file, typically located in `src/styles/`.
*   **Override Variables:** In this file, override Ant Design's default Less variables to change global styles like:
    *   Primary color (`@primary-color`)
    *   Link color (`@link-color`)
    *   Border radius (`@border-radius-base`)
    *   Font family (`@font-family`)
    *   Other common variables for layout, components, etc.
*   **Import in Main Less File:** Import this `theme.less` file into your main Less entry point (e.g., `src/styles/index.less` or directly in `vite.config.js` if using Less plugin options) so that these overrides are applied globally.
*   **Vite Configuration:** Ensure Vite is configured to process Less files and apply these theme overrides. This might involve adding `less` as a dev dependency and configuring it in `vite.config.ts`:
    ```typescript
    // vite.config.ts
    export default {
      css: {
        preprocessorOptions: {
          less: {
            modifyVars: {
              // Alternatively, load variables from your theme.less file here
              // 'hack': `true; @import (reference) "src/styles/theme.less";`,
              // Or directly specify overrides:
              // 'primary-color': '#1DA57A',
            },
            javascriptEnabled: true,
          },
        },
      },
    };
    ```
    Refer to Ant Design documentation for the most up-to-date method of integrating theme overrides with Vite.

## 3. Component-Specific Styles

When a component requires styles that are not achievable through Ant Design props or global theme overrides, scoped styling methods are preferred:

*   **CSS Modules (`.module.less` or `.module.css`):**
    *   Create style files with the `.module.less` (or `.module.css`) extension (e.g., `MyComponent.module.less`).
    *   Import styles into your component: `import styles from './MyComponent.module.less';`
    *   Use class names as object properties: `<div className={styles.myCustomClass}>...</div>`.
    *   This locally scopes class names, preventing global conflicts.
*   **Styled-components / CSS-in-JS (Alternative):**
    *   If the team has a strong preference, CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion can be used. However, CSS Modules offer a good balance of scoping and standard CSS/Less syntax.

## 4. Global Styles (`src/styles/index.less` or `src/styles/global.less`)

*   **Minimize Usage:** Global styles should be kept to a minimum.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Importing the Ant Design base stylesheet (e.g., `antd/dist/reset.css` or the Less equivalent).
    *   Importing the custom theme file (`theme.less`).
    *   Defining very generic helper classes or base HTML element styling if absolutely necessary.
*   **Avoid Overriding Ant Design Globally:** Do not write broad, unspecific selectors that override Ant Design's core component styles globally, as this can lead to maintenance issues and unexpected behavior. Prefer theme customization or scoped component styles.

## 5. Utility Classes

*   Consider using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS *if* it aligns with the project's overall styling philosophy and the team is comfortable with it. However, with Ant Design, this is often not necessary as Ant Design provides many utility props and layout components.
*   If not using a full utility framework, define a small set of common utility classes in `src/styles/utils.less` if needed (e.g., for margins, padding, text alignment, if not easily handled by Ant Design props).

By following these guidelines, the project can achieve a consistent and maintainable styling architecture, leveraging the strengths of Ant Design while allowing for necessary customizations.
