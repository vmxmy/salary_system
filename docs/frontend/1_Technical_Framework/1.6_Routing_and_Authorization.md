# 1.6 Routing and Authorization (Frontend v2)

This document details the routing strategy and authorization mechanisms for the v2 frontend, based on Chapter 4 ("路由与权限控制") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Routing Library

*   **`react-router-dom`:** This library will be used for all client-side routing functionalities, including defining routes, handling navigation, and managing route parameters.

## 2. Route Definitions (`src/router/routes.ts`)

*   **Centralized Definition:** All application routes will be defined in a centralized file (e.g., `src/router/routes.ts`).
*   **Structure:** Each route definition object should include:
    *   `path`: The URL path for the route.
    *   `element`: The React component to render for this route (e.g., `<HomePage />`).
    *   `meta` (or similar property): An object to store additional information about the route, crucial for authorization and UI generation.
        *   `requiresAuth`: A boolean indicating if the route requires authentication.
        *   `requiredRoles`: An array of role codes (e.g., `['admin', 'hr_manager']`) that are allowed to access this route. If empty or undefined, and `requiresAuth` is true, any authenticated user can access it.
        *   `requiredPermissions`: An array of specific permission codes (e.g., `['employee:view', 'payroll:run']`) that are required. This allows for more granular control beyond roles.
        *   Other UI-related info: e.g., `title` for browser tab/breadcrumbs, `menuKey` for sidebar highlighting.
*   **Nested Routes:** Utilize nested routing capabilities of `react-router-dom` for layouts and sub-pages.

## 3. Authorization Strategy

Authorization is critical and will be implemented at multiple levels:

*   **Route-Level Authorization:** Preventing users from navigating to routes they are not permitted to access.
*   **UI-Element Level Authorization:** Dynamically showing/hiding or enabling/disabling UI elements (buttons, form fields, menu items) based on user permissions.
*   **API-Level Authorization:** The backend will always perform its own authorization checks. Frontend checks are primarily for UX.

## 4. Protected Routes (`src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

*   **Purpose:** A wrapper component (or a custom hook used within route elements) that checks if a user is authenticated and has the necessary roles/permissions before rendering the target route's component.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Access the current user's authentication status, roles, and permissions from the global state (e.g., Redux store).
    2.  Check the `meta` information (e.g., `requiresAuth`, `requiredRoles`, `requiredPermissions`) of the route being accessed.
    3.  **If `requiresAuth` is true:**
        *   If the user is not authenticated, redirect to the login page (e.g., `/login`), possibly storing the intended destination to redirect back after login.
        *   If authenticated, proceed to check roles/permissions.
    4.  **Role Check:** If `requiredRoles` is defined and not empty, check if the user has at least one of the specified roles.
    5.  **Permission Check:** If `requiredPermissions` is defined and not empty, check if the user possesses ALL of the specified permissions.
    6.  **Access Denied:** If authentication, role, or permission checks fail, redirect the user to an appropriate page (e.g., a generic "Access Denied" page, or back to the dashboard).
    7.  **Access Granted:** If all checks pass, render the requested route's component.

## 5. UI Element Authorization

*   **Custom Hook (`usePermissions`):** A custom hook (e.g., `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`) can be created to simplify checking permissions within components.
    *   Example: `const { hasRole, hasPermission } = usePermissions();`
    *   `hasRole('admin')` would return true if the user is an admin.
    *   `hasPermission('employee:create')` would return true if the user has that specific permission.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Use the hook to conditionally render UI elements:
    ```tsx
    {hasPermission('employee:edit') && <Button>Edit Employee</Button>}
    ```

## 6. Dynamic Menu Generation

*   The main navigation menu (e.g., sidebar) should be dynamically generated based on the user's roles and permissions.
*   Filter the list of all possible application routes/menu items from `src/router/routes.ts` against the current user's roles/permissions.
*   Only display menu items for routes the user is authorized to access.
*   This prevents users from even seeing links to sections they cannot use, improving UX.

## 7. Login and Token Handling

*   Upon successful login, the backend provides a JWT (or similar token) and user information including roles and permissions.
*   The token is stored securely (e.g., `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`, considering security implications like XSS).
*   User roles and permissions are stored in the global state (Redux store).
*   The API integration layer (`src/api/`) automatically includes the token in the `Authorization` header for authenticated requests.
*   Logout functionality must clear the token from storage and reset the authentication state in the Redux store.

This multi-layered approach ensures robust authorization, providing both security and a good user experience by tailoring the application to each user's permitted actions.
