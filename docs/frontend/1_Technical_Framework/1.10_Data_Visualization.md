# 1.10 Data Visualization (Frontend v2)

This document outlines the strategy for data visualization and chart components in the v2 frontend, based on Chapter 10 ("数据可视化与图表组件") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Charting Library: @ant-design/charts

**`@ant-design/charts`** is the chosen library for implementing data visualizations.

*   **Rationale:**
    *   Seamless integration with the Ant Design ecosystem.
    *   Provides a wide variety of common chart types (Column, Line, Pie, Bar, etc.).
    *   Offers a declarative API that is relatively easy to use with React.
    *   Good documentation and examples.
    *   Supports responsive charts.

## 2. Chart Component Structure (`src/components/charts/`)

Dedicated chart components will be created in `src/components/charts/` to encapsulate specific visualization logic and make them reusable.

*   **Example Structure:**
    ```
    src/components/charts/
    ├── SalaryBarChart.tsx          // Example: Monthly salary sum by establishment type
    ├── PayrollDistributionPieChart.tsx // Example: Distribution of payroll components
    ├── DepartmentComparisonChart.tsx // Example: Comparing salary metrics across departments
    └── ChartUtils.ts               // Utility functions for chart data preparation or common configurations
    ```

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

*   **Data Fetching:** Chart components will typically receive data as props or fetch data themselves via API service calls if they are highly specific and self-contained.
*   **Data Transformation:** Prepare data in the format required by `@ant-design/charts`. This might involve mapping, filtering, or aggregating data before passing it to the chart component configuration.
*   **Configuration Object:** Each chart type from `@ant-design/charts` requires a configuration object that defines data, x/y fields, labels, tooltips, colors, etc.
*   **Loading States:** Implement loading indicators (e.g., Ant Design `Spin`) while chart data is being fetched.
*   **Empty States:** Provide a clear message (e.g., "No data available") when there is no data to display in the chart.
*   **Interactivity:** Utilize built-in interactivity features like tooltips. Implement custom event handlers if more complex interactions are needed.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure charts are as accessible as possible. Provide titles and consider ARIA attributes if necessary. Note that complex data visualizations can be challenging for accessibility; consider providing data in tabular format as an alternative where appropriate.

## 4. Example: Salary Bar Chart (Conceptual from V2 Docs)

The `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md` provides an example of a `SalaryBarChart.tsx` component that displays monthly salary sums grouped by establishment type. Key aspects of such a component would include:

*   **Props:** Accepts parameters like `payPeriod` to fetch relevant data.
*   **State:** Manages `data` for the chart and a `loading` state.
*   **`useEffect` Hook:** Fetches data from an API endpoint (e.g., `/v2/salary-data/summary-by-type`) when `payPeriod` changes.
*   **Data Mapping:** Transforms the API response into the `data` array format expected by the `Column` chart from `@ant-design/charts` (e.g., mapping `establishment_type_name` to `type` and `total_salary` to `value`).
*   **Chart Configuration:** Defines `xField`, `yField`, `label`, `meta` (for aliases and formatting), and `color` scheme.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Shows a spinner during loading, the chart when data is available, or a "No data" message.

## 5. Placement in UI

Charts should be strategically placed within relevant pages or dashboards to provide quick insights.

*   Example: The conceptual `SalaryBarChart` could be placed at the top of a salary records viewing page to give an overview before users dive into detailed table data.

By using `@ant-design/charts` and creating dedicated, reusable chart components, the frontend can effectively present data in a visually appealing and informative manner.
