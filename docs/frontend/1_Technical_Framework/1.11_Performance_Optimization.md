# 1.11 Performance Optimization (Frontend v2)

This document outlines strategies for frontend performance optimization, based on Chapter 14 ("性能优化指南") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. General Principles

*   **Measure First:** Before optimizing, use browser developer tools (Profiler, Performance tabs) and tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest to identify actual bottlenecks.
*   **Targeted Optimizations:** Focus on optimizations that yield the most significant improvements for the user experience.
*   **Balance:** Strive for a balance between performance, code readability, and development effort.

## 2. Build-Time Optimizations (Vite)

*   **Production Builds:** Always use `vite build` for production deployments. Vite automatically applies many optimizations:
    *   Code splitting (lazy loading of routes and components).
    *   Minification (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    *   Tree shaking to remove unused code.
    *   Asset optimization (e.g., hashing for caching).
*   **Bundle Analysis:** Use tools like `rollup-plugin-visualizer` (integrated with Vite) to analyze bundle sizes and identify large dependencies or chunks that could be optimized or code-split further.

## 3. React Performance Techniques

*   **`React.memo`:** Wrap functional components with `React.memo` to prevent re-renders if their props have not changed. Use judiciously, especially for components that render frequently or have expensive render logic.
*   **`useMemo`:** Memoize the results of expensive calculations. Recompute only if dependencies change.
*   **`useCallback`:** Memoize callback functions passed to child components, preventing unnecessary re-renders of those children if they depend on the callback's referential equality (often used with `React.memo`).
*   **Keys for Lists:** Always use stable, unique, and predictable `key` props when rendering lists of elements to help React efficiently update the DOM.
*   **Virtualization (Windowing):** For long lists or large tables, use virtualization libraries (e.g., `react-window`, `react-virtualized`, or Ant Design Table's built-in virtualization if applicable) to render only the visible items in the viewport, significantly improving rendering performance.
*   **Lazy Loading Components:** Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to code-split and lazy-load components that are not immediately needed on the initial page load (e.g., components in modals, tabs, or less frequently accessed routes).

## 4. State Management Performance

*   **Selectors (Redux Toolkit):** Use memoized selectors (e.g., with `createSelector` from `reselect`) to compute derived data from the Redux store. This prevents unnecessary re-calculations if the underlying state has not changed.
*   **Subscribe to Specific State:** When using `useSelector`, subscribe to the smallest possible pieces of state needed by the component to avoid unnecessary re-renders when unrelated parts of the state tree change.
*   **Avoid Over-Fetching:** Fetch only the data necessary for the current view. Implement proper caching strategies for API responses (RTK Query in Redux Toolkit provides this out-of-the-box).

## 5. Asset Optimization

*   **Image Optimization:**
    *   Use appropriate image formats (e.g., WebP for modern browsers, JPG for photos, PNG for transparency, SVG for icons).
    *   Compress images without significant quality loss using tools like ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or build-time plugins.
    *   Use responsive images (`<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute) to serve appropriately sized images for different screen resolutions.
*   **Lazy Loading Images:** Use `loading="lazy"` attribute on `<img>` tags for offscreen images (native browser support).
*   **Code Splitting:** As handled by Vite, ensures JavaScript is loaded in smaller chunks as needed.
*   **Caching:** Configure server-side caching headers (ETag, Cache-Control) correctly for static assets.

## 6. Network Performance

*   **Minimize Requests:** Reduce the number of HTTP requests (though less critical with HTTP/2).
*   **Payload Size:** Keep API response payloads as small as possible. Paginate large datasets.
*   **Debouncing and Throttling:** Use debouncing for events like search input (delaying API calls until user stops typing) and throttling for events like window resize or scroll to limit the frequency of handler execution.
*   **CDN:** Serve static assets from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce latency for users globally.

## 7. Rendering Performance

*   **Avoid Unnecessary Renders:** Profile components using React Developer Tools to identify components that re-render too often and apply memoization techniques where appropriate.
*   **Efficient DOM Updates:** React's reconciliation algorithm is generally efficient, but be mindful of large DOM structures or frequent, widespread updates.

## 8. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically run Lighthouse or other performance auditing tools against the production application.
*   **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Consider integrating RUM tools to gather performance data from actual users in production.
*   **Performance Budget:** Define a performance budget (e.g., Lighthouse score targets, max bundle size, load time) and track against it.

By systematically applying these optimization techniques and continuously monitoring performance, the application can provide a fast and responsive user experience.
