# 1.12 Error Handling and Logging (Frontend v2)

This document describes the strategy for error handling and logging in the v2 frontend, based on Chapter 15 ("错误处理与日志") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Goals

*   **User Experience:** Prevent application crashes. Display user-friendly error messages instead of technical jargon or blank screens.
*   **Debugging:** Provide developers with sufficient information to diagnose and fix errors quickly.
*   **Monitoring:** Enable tracking of frontend errors to identify patterns and proactively address issues.

## 2. Types of Errors

*   **JavaScript Errors:** Runtime errors in the client-side code (e.g., type errors, undefined variable access).
*   **React Rendering Errors:** Errors occurring within React component lifecycle methods or render functions.
*   **API/Network Errors:** Errors related to fetching data from the backend (e.g., network failures, HTTP error statuses like 4xx, 5xx).
*   **Application Logic Errors:** Errors stemming from incorrect business logic implementation.

## 3. Error Handling Mechanisms

*   **Global Error Boundary (React):**
    *   Implement a top-level React Error Boundary component that wraps the entire application or significant parts of it.
    *   This component will catch JavaScript errors occurring in its child component tree during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors.
    *   It should render a fallback UI (e.g., a generic "Something went wrong" message with an option to reload or contact support) instead of a crashed component tree.
    *   Log the error details to a remote logging service (see Logging section).
*   **`try...catch` Blocks:**
    *   Use `try...catch` blocks for handling errors in imperative code, especially around `async/await` operations like API calls.
    *   Catch specific errors and handle them gracefully (e.g., display a specific message, retry, or fall back to a default state).
*   **Promise `.catch()`:**
    *   For Promise-based operations not using `async/await`, use the `.catch()` method to handle rejections.
*   **API Service Layer Error Handling:**
    *   As detailed in `1.8_API_Integration.md`, Axios interceptors in the API service layer will handle common HTTP error responses globally (e.g., 401, 403, 500).
    *   These interceptors can dispatch actions to show notifications, redirect users, or log errors before re-throwing or returning a structured error object.
*   **Component-Level Error Handling:**
    *   Individual components can implement local error handling for specific operations they perform (e.g., form validation errors, errors in specific user interactions).
    *   Display contextual error messages close to the UI element causing the error.

## 4. User Feedback for Errors

*   **Ant Design `message` and `notification`:** Use these components to display non-intrusive feedback to users for recoverable errors or important warnings.
    *   `message.error('Failed to save data. Please try again.')`
    *   `notification.error({ message: 'Connection Error', description: 'Could not connect to the server.' })`
*   **Form Validation Errors:** Display validation errors directly beneath the relevant form fields (Ant Design `Form` handles this well).
*   **Fallback UI:** For critical, unrecoverable errors caught by an Error Boundary, display a user-friendly page that doesn't expose technical details.

## 5. Logging Strategy

*   **Console Logging (Development):**
    *   Use `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, `console.error()` extensively during development for debugging.
    *   These should be minimized or removed in production builds for most non-critical messages to avoid cluttering the console and potential performance impact.
*   **Remote Logging Service (Production):**
    *   Integrate a third-party remote logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, Datadog Real User Monitoring).
    *   **What to log:**
        *   Errors caught by the global Error Boundary (including component stack traces).
        *   Unhandled promise rejections.
        *   Significant API call failures (especially 5xx errors or unexpected 4xx errors).
        *   Critical application logic errors.
    *   **Information to include in logs:**
        *   Error message and stack trace.
        *   Component stack trace (if applicable, from Error Boundary).
        *   User information (ID, role - if available and PII compliance is ensured).
        *   Browser/OS information.
        *   Application version.
        *   Redux state snapshot (be cautious with sensitive data) or relevant parts of it.
        *   Network request/response details for API errors (strip sensitive data).
*   **Source Maps:** Ensure production builds generate and upload source maps to the logging service. This allows for de-obfuscating minified production code and getting readable stack traces.

## 6. Debugging

*   **Browser Developer Tools:** Essential for inspecting the DOM, network requests, console output, and debugging JavaScript.
*   **React Developer Tools (Browser Extension):** Inspect React component hierarchies, props, and state.
*   **Redux DevTools (Browser Extension):** Inspect Redux store state, dispatched actions, and time-travel debugging.
*   **Source Maps:** Crucial for debugging production issues by mapping compiled code back to the original source.

By implementing a robust error handling and logging strategy, the development team can improve application stability, enhance the user experience when errors occur, and efficiently diagnose and resolve issues.
