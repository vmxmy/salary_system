# 1.8 API Integration (Frontend v2)

This document outlines the strategy for API integration in the v2 frontend, based on Chapter 6 ("API 集成") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. API Service Layer (`src/api/`)

All interactions with the backend RESTful APIs will be encapsulated within a dedicated API service layer, typically located in the `src/api/` directory.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Centralize API call logic.
    *   Decouple components and pages from direct HTTP request implementation.
    *   Simplify API updates and maintenance.
    *   Handle common API-related tasks (authentication, error handling, data transformation).

*   **Structure (example within `src/api/`):
    *   `index.ts` (or `apiClient.ts`): Exports an Axios instance configured with base URL and interceptors.
    *   `auth.ts`: Functions for authentication-related API calls (login, logout, register).
    *   `employees.ts`: Functions for employee data management APIs.
    *   `payroll.ts`: Functions for payroll processing APIs.
    *   `config.ts`: Functions for fetching system configuration data.
    *   `types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces and types for API request payloads and response data structures. This ensures type safety across the frontend and a clear contract with the backend.

## 2. HTTP Client: Axios

**Axios** is the chosen HTTP client for making API requests.

*   **Reasons:**
    *   Promise-based, supporting `async/await`.
    *   Request and response interceptors for global handling of auth, logging, errors.
    *   Automatic transformation of JSON data.
    *   Ability to cancel requests.
    *   Browser and Node.js support (though primarily used in browser for frontend).

## 3. Common API Logic Handled in Service Layer

The API service layer will be responsible for:

*   **Authentication Token Injection:** Automatically attaching the JWT (or other auth token) to the `Authorization` header for all authenticated requests. This is typically done using an Axios request interceptor.
*   **Global Error Handling:** Implementing a response interceptor to catch common HTTP error statuses:
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Redirect to the login page, potentially clearing stale auth state.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Display an access denied message or redirect.
    *   `5xx Server Errors`: Display a generic error message to the user and log detailed error information.
*   **Data Transformation (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Transforming request payloads if the backend expects a different format (e.g., `camelCase` to `snake_case`).
    *   Transforming response data if the frontend prefers a different format (e.g., `snake_case` from backend to `camelCase` for frontend JavaScript/TypeScript consistency).
*   **Base URL Configuration:** Setting the base URL for all API requests, typically sourced from environment variables (e.g., `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

## 4. API Naming Conventions and Contract

*   **URL Paths:** Backend API endpoints should follow a consistent RESTful pattern. The frontend will consume these as defined.
    *   As per `前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`: URLs should use kebab-case (e.g., `/v2/salary-data`).
*   **Frontend Code (Variables/Functions):** Use camelCase for functions and variables related to API calls (e.g., `fetchEmployeeData`, `employeeDetails`).
*   **Request/Response Data (Backend):** If the backend uses `snake_case` for JSON properties, the API service layer or Axios interceptors should handle the transformation to/from `camelCase` for frontend usage to maintain consistency within the JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
*   **Typed Contracts (`api/types.ts`):** All API request and response structures should be strongly typed using TypeScript interfaces or types. This provides compile-time checks and improves developer experience when working with API data.

## 5. Usage in Components/Pages

*   Components, pages, or Redux thunks will import and call functions from the API service layer to fetch or submit data.
*   They should not make direct HTTP requests using Axios or `fetch`.
*   Example:
    ```typescript
    // In a Redux thunk or component
    import { getEmployeeById } from '../../api/employees';

    const fetchEmployee = async (id: string) => {
      try {
        const employee = await getEmployeeById(id);
        // dispatch action with employee data
      } catch (error) {
        // handle error
      }
    };
    ```

This structured approach to API integration promotes maintainability, type safety, and separation of concerns.
