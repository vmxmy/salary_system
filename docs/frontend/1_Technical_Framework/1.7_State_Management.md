# 1.7 State Management (Frontend v2)

This document outlines the state management strategy for the v2 frontend, primarily based on Chapter 5 ("状态管理") of `docs/v2/前端界面2.0开发文档（优化版）.md`.

## 1. Chosen Solution: Redux Toolkit

**Redux Toolkit** is the selected library for global state management in this project. It provides a standardized and efficient way to manage complex application state.

*   **Rationale:**
    *   Simplifies Redux development with utilities like `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`.
    *   Enforces best practices (e.g., immutability via Immer).
    *   Good performance and strong community support.
    *   Excellent TypeScript integration.
    *   Scales well for larger applications.

## 2. Global State vs. Local State

*   **Global State (Redux Toolkit):** Use for state that needs to be shared across multiple, potentially unrelated, components or affects the application as a whole. Examples include:
    *   User authentication status (e.g., JWT token, `isLoggedIn` flag).
    *   Currently logged-in user's profile information (username, roles, permissions).
    *   Application-wide configuration data fetched from the backend (e.g., lookup values, system settings).
    *   State related to cross-cutting concerns like notifications or global loading indicators.
*   **Local State (React Hooks):** Use React's built-in `useState` and `useReducer` for state that is confined to a single component or a small group of closely related components. Examples include:
    *   Form input values and validation status.
    *   UI state like modal visibility, active tabs, or dropdown open/close status.
    *   Temporary data specific to a component's rendering logic (e.g., pagination state, sort order for a local table).

## 3. Redux Toolkit Implementation (`src/store/`)

*   **Store Configuration (`src/store/index.ts`):**
    *   Configure the main Redux store using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit.
    *   Combine all slice reducers here.
    *   Middleware (like `thunk` for async actions, which is included by default) is set up here.
*   **Slices (`src/store/slices/`):**
    *   Define state slices using `createSlice`. Each slice typically corresponds to a specific feature or domain of the application state (e.g., `authSlice.ts`, `userSlice.ts`, `employeeSlice.ts`).
    *   `createSlice` automatically generates action creators and action types.
    *   Reducers within slices can safely "mutate" state due to Immer integration.
*   **Async Actions (`createAsyncThunk`):**
    *   Use `createAsyncThunk` within slices to handle asynchronous operations, particularly API calls.
    *   It dispatches pending, fulfilled, and rejected action types, allowing reducers to update state based on the outcome of the async operation (e.g., setting loading status, storing fetched data, or handling errors).
*   **Hooks (`src/store/hooks.ts`):**
    *   Create and export pre-typed versions of `useDispatch` and `useSelector` (e.g., `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector`) for better TypeScript integration throughout the application.

## 4. Best Practices for Redux Toolkit Usage

*   **Keep Reducers Pure:** Reducers should be pure functions, only calculating the next state based on the current state and action.
*   **Normalize State:** For collections of data (e.g., lists of employees), consider normalizing the state shape (e.g., using an object زيتون keyed by ID) for easier lookups and updates.
*   **Selectors:** Use `createSelector` (from `reselect`, often used with Redux) for memoized selectors to compute derived data and optimize performance, especially for complex state transformations.
*   **Avoid Direct State Mutation in Components:** Always dispatch actions to update the Redux store. Do not attempt to modify the store state directly from components.
*   **Minimal Data in Store:** Store only the necessary data in Redux. Avoid storing redundant or easily derivable data.
*   **Side Effects in Thunks:** Business logic involving API calls or other side effects should be handled within thunks created by `createAsyncThunk` or other middleware, not directly in reducers or components.

By adhering to these principles and leveraging Redux Toolkit effectively, the application can maintain a predictable, manageable, and scalable state.
