# 1.3.3 Migration Strategies (Backend v2)

This document outlines the strategies and tools used for managing database schema migrations for the v2 backend of the Salary Information Management System.

## 1. Tooling

*   **Alembic:** The primary tool used for database migrations. Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, providing a system for versioning database schemas and deploying changes programmatically.
*   **SQLAlchemy:** Used as the ORM, and Alembic integrates with SQLAlchemy models to auto-generate migration scripts (though manual adjustments are often necessary for complex changes).

## 2. Migration Workflow

1.  **Model Changes:** When SQLAlchemy models (`webapp/v2/models/`) are modified (e.g., adding a table, altering a column), a new migration script needs to be generated.
2.  **Generate Migration Script:**
    ```bash
    # Example command (executed from the directory containing alembic.ini)
    alembic revision -m "Descriptive_name_for_migration"
    ```
3.  **Edit Migration Script:** Alembic auto-generates a draft. This script (located in `webapp/alembic/versions/` or `webapp/v2/alembic_for_db_v2/versions/` - **confirm correct path for V2**) must be reviewed and edited to accurately reflect the desired schema changes. The script `docs/v2/alembc 脚本.md` provides an example of such a script, likely for the initial schema creation, detailing `op.create_schema()`, `op.create_table()`, `sa.Column()`, `sa.ForeignKey()`, etc.
    *   The `upgrade()` function defines the changes to apply.
    *   The `downgrade()` function defines how to revert the changes.
4.  **Apply Migrations:**
    ```bash
    # Apply all pending migrations
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
5.  **Version Control:** Migration scripts are committed to the version control system (Git) along with model changes, ensuring that the schema can be recreated and versioned consistently across all environments.

## 3. Key Considerations & Best Practices

*   **Idempotency:** Migration scripts should ideally be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects (though Alembic handles versioning to prevent re-applying applied migrations).
*   **Reversibility:** Always implement the `downgrade()` function to allow for rolling back migrations if issues arise. This is crucial for production environments.
*   **Data Migrations:** For changes that involve data transformation or movement (not just schema changes), separate data migration scripts or operations within the Alembic script might be necessary. These require careful planning and testing.
    *   Example: If a column is renamed, data needs to be moved from the old column to the new one before the old column is dropped.
*   **No Downtime Migrations (Advanced):** For critical systems, strategies for applying migrations with no or minimal downtime should be considered. This might involve phased rollouts or specific SQL techniques.
*   **Testing:** Test migrations thoroughly in development and staging environments before applying them to production.
*   **Atomic Operations:** Group related schema changes into a single migration script where possible to maintain consistency.
*   **Branching and Merging:** Handle Alembic migration history carefully when working with feature branches to avoid conflicts in the migration timeline. Rebasing or merge strategies for migration scripts should be agreed upon by the team.

## 4. Initial Schema Setup

The document `docs/v2/alembc 脚本.md` contains what appears to be the initial Alembic migration script (`upgrade()` function) responsible for:
*   Creating the `config`, `hr`, `payroll`, and `security` schemas.
*   Defining and creating tables within these schemas, including columns, primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints, and default values.
    *   This includes tables like `config.lookup_types`, `config.lookup_values`, `hr.employees`, `hr.departments`, `payroll.payroll_periods`, etc.

This initial script sets the baseline for the database schema.
