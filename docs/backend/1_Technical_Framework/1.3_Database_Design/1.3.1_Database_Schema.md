# 1.3.1 Database Schema (Backend v2)

This document outlines the database schema design for the v2 backend of the Salary Information Management System. The design emphasizes configurability, use of JSONB for variable data, and effective dating for historical records.

## 1. Schema Overview

The database is logically divided into multiple schemas to group related tables and provide better organization and isolation. Based on `docs/v2/数据库 2.0 说明.md`, the primary schemas are:

*   **`config`**: Stores system-wide configurations, lookup values, rule definitions, and other metadata. This schema is crucial for minimizing hard-coding and externalizing system behavior.
    *   Examples: `lookup_types`, `lookup_values`, `system_parameters`, `payroll_component_definitions`, `tax_brackets`, `social_security_rates`.
*   **`hr`**: Contains tables related to core human resources information, organizational structure, job titles, employee contracts, and employment history.
    *   Examples: `employees`, `departments`, `job_titles`, `employee_job_history`, `employee_contracts`, `employee_compensation_history`.
*   **`payroll`**: Houses tables for payroll periods, payroll calculation results, detailed payroll entries, and related data.
    *   *(Details to be extracted from subsequent readings of `docs/v2/数据库 2.0 说明.md`)*
*   **`security`**: Manages user accounts, roles, permissions, and other access control information.

## 2. Design Principles

*   **Normalization (with pragmatism):** Strive for a normalized design to reduce data redundancy, while allowing for denormalization where appropriate for performance or simplicity (e.g., using JSONB fields).
*   **Effective Dating:** Widely used in `hr` and `config` schemas to track historical changes and maintain data integrity over time (e.g., `effective_date`, `end_date` fields).
*   **Foreign Key Constraints:** Enforce referential integrity between related tables.
*   **Data Types:** Appropriate use of PostgreSQL data types (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `BIGINT`, `NUMERIC`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, `JSONB`, `BOOLEAN`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Consistent naming for schemas, tables, and columns (e.g., lowercase with underscores).

## 3. Relationships

Key relationships exist between tables within and across schemas. For example:

*   `hr.employees` links to `config.lookup_values` for status, gender, etc.
*   `hr.employee_job_history` links to `hr.employees`, `hr.departments`, and `hr.job_titles`.
*   Payroll tables will link extensively to `hr.employees` and `config` tables.

*Detailed table structures and relationships are documented in `1.3.2_Data_Models.md`. This overview is based on the initial segment of `docs/v2/数据库 2.0 说明.md`.*
