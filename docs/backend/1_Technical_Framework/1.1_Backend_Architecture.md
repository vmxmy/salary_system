# 1.1 Backend Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for the backend system of the Salary Information Management System (v2).

## 1. Architectural Goals

*   **Modularity:** Design components that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
*   **Scalability:** Ensure the architecture can handle growth in data volume and user traffic.
*   **Maintainability:** Code should be well-organized, documented, and easy to modify or extend.
*   **Security:** Implement security best practices at all layers of the architecture.
*   **Testability:** Design for ease of unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## 2. Core Architectural Style

*   **RESTful API:** The backend exposes a RESTful API for communication with the frontend and potentially other services. This is the primary interface to the backend logic and data.
*   **Layered Architecture (Conceptual):**
    *   **Presentation/API Layer (FastAPI Routers):** Handles HTTP requests, request validation (Pydantic), authentication, and routing to appropriate services. Responsible for formatting API responses.
    *   **Service/Business Logic Layer (Services/CRUD modules):** Encapsulates the core business logic, orchestrates operations, and interacts with the data access layer. This layer ensures that business rules are enforced.
    *   **Data Access Layer (SQLAlchemy ORM & Models):** Responsible for all database interactions, abstracting the database schema and providing an object-oriented way to access data.
    *   **Database Layer (PostgreSQL):** The persistent storage for all application data.

## 3. Key Design Principles (from API Design v2)

*   **Resource-Oriented:** Key concepts (employees, departments, payrolls) are treated as resources with unique URIs.
*   **Statelessness:** Each request from the client contains all information needed by the server to fulfill it. No client session state is stored on the server.
*   **HTTP Method Adherence:** Strict use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for their defined semantics.
*   **Consistent URI Design:** Versioned URIs (e.g., `/v2/...`), plural nouns for collections.
*   **Standardized Response Formats:** JSON for request/response bodies. Consistent success and error response structures.
*   **Security:** HTTPS for all communication, JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization.
*   **Versioning:** API versioning via URI path (`/v2/`).

## 4. Major Components & Modules (Conceptual)

*   **Authentication & Authorization Module:** Handles user login, token generation/validation, role and permission management.
*   **Employee Management Module:** Manages employee data, contracts, job history, compensation.
*   **Payroll Processing Module:** Handles payroll periods, payroll runs, salary calculations, payslip generation, and bank export files.
*   **Leave Management Module:** Manages leave types, employee leave balances, leave requests, and approvals.
*   **System Configuration Module:** Manages lookup values, system parameters, payroll component definitions, tax/SS rates.
*   **Reporting & Analytics Module:** (Future) Provides data for reports and dashboards.
*   **Logging & Auditing Module:** Records important system events and changes for auditing purposes.

## 5. Data Management

*   **Database:** PostgreSQL.
*   **ORM:** SQLAlchemy for object-relational mapping.
*   **Migrations:** Alembic for managing database schema changes.
*   **Data Models:** Pydantic models for data validation and serialization/deserialization at the API layer; SQLAlchemy models for database representation.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

*   **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling mechanisms to provide consistent error responses.
*   **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.
*   **Configuration Management:** Externalized configuration for different environments.
