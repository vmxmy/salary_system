# 1.5 Coding Standards and Guidelines (Backend v2)

This document outlines the coding standards and guidelines to be followed for the backend development of the Salary Information Management System (v2). Adherence to these standards is crucial for maintaining code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## 1. General Principles

*   **Readability:** Write code that is easy to read and understand. Prioritize clarity over conciseness if conciseness obscures meaning.
*   **Simplicity (KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Prefer simpler solutions where possible.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication. Use functions, classes, and modules to encapsulate reusable logic.
*   **Consistency:** Follow consistent naming conventions, formatting, and architectural patterns throughout the codebase.

## 2. Python Language Standards

*   **PEP 8:** Adhere to [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
    *   Use a linter (e.g., Flake8, Pylint) and a formatter (e.g., Black, autopep8) to enforce PEP 8 compliance automatically.
*   **Type Hinting (PEP 484):** Use type hints for all function signatures and important variables to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
*   **Docstrings (PEP 257):** Write clear and concise docstrings for all modules, classes, functions, and methods. Follow a standard format (e.g., Google style, NumPy style).
*   **Imports:**
    *   Organize imports according to PEP 8 (standard library, third-party, local application/library specific).
    *   Use tools like `isort` to automatically sort imports.

## 3. FastAPI Specific Guidelines

*   **Dependency Injection:** Utilize FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing dependencies (e.g., database sessions, service instances).
*   **Pydantic Models:** Use Pydantic models extensively for request/response validation and serialization. Define clear and precise schemas.
*   **Routers:** Organize API endpoints into logical groups using `APIRouter`.
*   **Asynchronous Code (`async`/`await`):** Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to leverage FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities, especially for database calls and external API requests.

## 4. SQLAlchemy Specific Guidelines

*   **Explicit Naming:** Use clear and explicit names for models, columns, and relationships.
*   **Session Management:** Manage SQLAlchemy sessions carefully, typically using FastAPI's dependency injection to provide a session per request.
*   **Query Optimization:** Be mindful of query performance. Use appropriate loading strategies (e.g., `selectinload`, `joinedload`) to avoid N+1 problems.

## 5. Naming Conventions

*   **Modules:** Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `user_service.py`).
*   **Packages:** Lowercase, preferably short (e.g., `routers`, `models`).
*   **Classes:** CapWords (e.g., `UserService`, `EmployeeModel`).
*   **Functions and Methods:** Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `get_user_by_id`, `create_employee`).
*   **Variables:** Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `current_user`, `total_salary`).
*   **Constants:** All uppercase with underscores (e.g., `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`).

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

*   **Custom Exceptions:** Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions in the business logic.
*   **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging approach (e.g., logging in JSON format) to make logs easier to parse and analyze. Include contextual information in log messages.
*   **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

## 7. Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual functions and methods, especially for business logic in services.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different components (e.g., service layer and data access layer).
*   **API/Endpoint Tests:** Test API endpoints to ensure they behave as expected (using tools like `pytest` with `HTTPX` or FastAPI's `TestClient`).
*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for a reasonable level of test coverage.

## 8. Security

*   **Input Validation:** Always validate all incoming data (FastAPI with Pydantic helps greatly here).
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Secrets Management:** Do not hardcode secrets (API keys, database passwords). Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure components and users only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

## 9. Code Reviews

*   All code should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.
*   Focus reviews on correctness, clarity, performance, security, and adherence to standards.

*This document provides general guidelines. Specific project decisions or conventions agreed upon by the team will supersede these general recommendations. Refer to `docs/v2/项目开发核心信息.md` which indicates this section is to be further populated with V2 specifics.*
