# 0. Backend Overview and Roadmap

This document provides an overview of the backend development for the Salary Information Management System, its goals, and the development roadmap.

## 1. Backend System Goals

*   **Robustness and Scalability:** Develop a backend system capable of handling current and future data volumes and user load, ensuring high availability and reliability.
*   **Security:** Implement comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive employee and payroll data, including secure API endpoints, data encryption, and access controls.
*   **Efficiency:** Optimize database queries and business logic to ensure fast response times for all API requests.
*   **Maintainability:** Design a modular and well-documented backend architecture that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
*   **Comprehensive API Coverage:** Provide a complete set of APIs to support all frontend functionalities, including employee management, payroll processing, leave management, system configuration, and reporting.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure accuracy and consistency of data through proper validation, transaction management, and data model design.

## 2. Core Technologies (V2)

*   **Framework:** FastAPI (>=0.95.0)
*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (>=2.0.0)
*   **Migrations:** Alembic (>=1.10.0)
*   **Authentication:** python-jose[cryptography], passlib[bcrypt]
*   **Data Validation:** Pydantic (>=2.0.0)
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   *Refer to `docs/backend/1_Technical_Framework/1.4_Technology_Stack_and_Libraries.md` for a complete list.*

## 3. High-Level Backend Roadmap (Illustrative)

This roadmap outlines the major phases for backend development. Refer to `docs/backend/2_Development_Tasks_and_Phases/2.1_Current_Development_Plan.md` for detailed current tasks.

*   **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication (Completed/Ongoing)**
    *   Setup FastAPI project structure and V2 database schema.
    *   Implement user authentication and authorization (JWT-based).
    *   Core User and Role management APIs.
    *   Basic organization structure APIs (Departments, Job Titles).

*   **Phase 2: Core HR & Payroll Modules (Ongoing/Next)**
    *   Employee information management APIs (CRUD operations, history).
    *   Payroll period and payroll run management APIs.
    *   Salary data import and validation services.
    *   Initial payroll calculation logic (core components).
    *   Payslip generation (data preparation).

*   **Phase 3: ESS/MSS Support & System Configuration**
    *   APIs to support Employee Self-Service (viewing payslips, personal info, leave requests).
    *   APIs to support Manager Self-Service (approvals, subordinate data).
    *   Leave management module (application, approval, balance tracking).
    *   System configuration APIs (lookup values, payroll components, tax/social security settings).

*   **Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization**
    *   Reporting and analytics APIs.
    *   Audit logging for critical operations.
    *   Performance optimization and stress testing.
    *   Advanced security hardening.
    *   Integration points for potential future modules (e.g., performance management).

## 4. Key Milestones (To be defined based on detailed planning)

*   (Example) Milestone 1: Core HR APIs and Authentication stable.
*   (Example) Milestone 2: Payroll processing PoC complete.
*   (Example) Milestone 3: ESS/MSS backend support ready for frontend integration.
