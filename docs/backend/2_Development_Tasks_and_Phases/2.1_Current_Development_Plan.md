# 2.1 Backend Current Development Plan & Tasks (v2 API)

This document outlines the implementation plan and current status for the v2 Backend API, based on `docs/v2/v2_api_implementation_plan.md`.

## 1. Overall Goal

To create a fully independent v2 API module (`/v2/`) with its own database connection, routing, models (SQLAlchemy & Pydantic), and business logic (CRUD operations), adhering to RESTful design principles and providing unified response/error handling.

## 2. Key Implementation Steps & Status

*(Status as per `docs/v2/v2_api_implementation_plan.md` - this should be kept updated)*

1.  **Create Base Directory Structure (`webapp/v2/`)**: ✅ Completed
    *   Includes subdirectories for `models/`, `pydantic_models/`, `routers/`, `crud/`, etc.
2.  **Create Database Connection Module (`database.py`)**: ✅ Completed
3.  **Create SQLAlchemy ORM Models (`webapp/v2/models/`)**: ✅ Completed
    *   `config.py` (Config-related models)
    *   `hr.py` (HR-related models)
    *   `payroll.py` (Payroll-related models)
    *   `security.py` (Security-related models)
4.  **Create Pydantic Models (`webapp/v2/pydantic_models/`)**: ✅ Completed
    *   For API request/response validation and serialization, mirroring ORM structure.
5.  **Create CRUD Operations (`webapp/v2/crud/`)**: ✅ Completed
    *   Functions for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for each model type.
6.  **Create Core API Routers (`webapp/v2/routers/`)**: ✅ Completed
    *   `employees.py`
    *   `departments.py`
    *   `job_titles.py`
    *   `lookup.py`
7.  **Create Configuration API Routers**: ✅ Completed
    *   System Parameters (`config.py` in routers)
    *   Payroll Component Definitions
    *   Tax Brackets
    *   Social Security Rates
8.  **Create Payroll API Routers (`payroll.py` in routers)**: ✅ Completed
    *   Payroll Periods
    *   Payroll Runs (including `PATCH` for status updates, `GET` for bank export)
    *   Payroll Entries (including `PATCH` for updates)
9.  **Create Security API Routers**: ⏳ Partially Completed / In Progress (as per source doc: User, Role, Permission APIs were listed as "待完成" but some basic security models/CRUD were ✅)
    *   User management APIs
    *   Role management APIs
    *   Permission management APIs
10. **Integrate v2 Routers into Main Application (`webapp/main.py`)**: ✅ Completed
11. **Test API Interfaces**: ⏳ In Progress (Source doc: Marked as "待完成" overall, though an API tester script `webapp/v2/scripts/api_tester.py` exists and core CRUDs were tested).
    *   Comprehensive testing of all endpoints for functionality and performance.
12. **Write API Documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger)**: ⏳ To Be Done (Auto-generated docs via FastAPI at `/v2/docs` will exist, but further descriptive documentation may be needed).
13. **Deployment to Production**: ❌ Not Started

## 3. Key API Endpoint Groups (Refer to `1.2_API_Design_and_Endpoints.md` for more details)

*   Employees (`/v2/employees`)
*   Departments (`/v2/departments`)
*   Job Titles (`/v2/job-titles`)
*   Lookup Values (`/v2/lookup/types`, `/v2/lookup/values`)
*   Configuration (`/v2/config/...` for parameters, components, tax, ss_rates)
*   Payroll (`/v2/payroll-periods`, `/v2/payroll-runs`, `/v2/payroll-entries`)
*   Security (`/v2/users`, `/v2/roles`, `/v2/permissions`, `/v2/token`)

## 4. Testing Strategy

*   Utilize the API testing script `webapp/v2/scripts/api_tester.py`.
*   Aim for comprehensive coverage of all endpoints and methods.
*   Test reports generated in JSON format.

## 5. Implementation Checklist (High-Level from Plan)
