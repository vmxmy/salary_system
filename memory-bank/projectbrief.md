# Project Brief

*This is the foundation document. Define core requirements and goals here.*

**Core Goal:** Build a data platform to manage and report on salary records sourced from Excel files. The platform will use PostgreSQL as the database, Airbyte for ETL (potentially requiring pre-processing for Excel), Metabase for BI and reporting, and a custom web frontend providing role-based access control (Finance, Department Head, Employee) to specific salary reports.
